// Exercise: Creating Objects
// In this exercise, you will use object oriented programming concepts to define and use a custom object in JavaScript.
// 1.Create the constructor function for a Video object. The function should take in arguments of title (a string),
// uploader (a string, the person who uploaded it), and seconds (a number, the duration), and it should save them as properties of the object.

const videoObject = function(title, uploader, seconds){
  this.title = title;
  this.uploader = uploader;
  this.duration = seconds;
  this.watch = function(){
	console.log(`You watched all ${this.duration} seconds of ${this.title}!`)
}
}
var test = new videoObject("Name","Upload by", 1)
// 2.Create a method on the Video object called watch(). When that method is called, it should use console.log to output a string like 
//“You watched all 60 seconds of Otters Holding Hands!”
test.watch()
// 3. Instantiate a new Video object and call the watch() method on it.
var test2 = new videoObject("Name2","Upload by2", 2)
